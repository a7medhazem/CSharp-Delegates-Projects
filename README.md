# ðŸŒŸ C# Console Projects â€” Practical Exploration of Advanced Concepts  

This repository contains **three focused console projects** designed to provide **hands-on practice** with key C# advanced concepts.  
Each project is a **practical exercise** that demonstrates how to apply:  

- **Delegates** (custom and built-in)  
- **Func, Action, and Predicate**  
- **Events & Event Handling**  
- **The Observer Pattern**  

Rather than full-scale applications, these projects serve as **educational exercises** â€” helping to build a solid understanding of advanced C# features through simple, well-structured examples.  

---

âœ… **Perfect for learners aiming to strengthen their C# foundation through practice.**
